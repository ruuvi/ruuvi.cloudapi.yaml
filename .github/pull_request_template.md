# Hello, thank you for contributing!

We're going to run some automated checks and a human will be here shortly.

Here is a quick checklist for the PR: 
- Is it valid OpenAPI Specification? 
- Does it match existing behaviour or is it a proposal? 
- Do you agree with the LICENSE in the project root?
- Can the PR be merged as-is, i.e. no merge conflicts? 

## Housekeeping

An automated check will verify that this PR is linked to an issue by looking for keywords like "fixes #123" or "closes #123" in the PR description. Please ensure you include such a keyword referencing the relevant issue, and that the issue has metadata for tracking the workflow. These checks help us detect if any issues or pull requests have been left hanging.
